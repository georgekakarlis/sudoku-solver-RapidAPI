# Sudoku Solver

Since Sudoku and 2048 are two of my favourite games to play on train, tram, metro I felt the need to make something like that to brushen up my plain-old (but BEST of) Javascript skills.

The logic here is to take the hardcoded data from the API and map them to the cells by using loop and playing around to display it as array. 

Simple, yet useful! :)

NOTE*** 

The application will not run with the API, because it is coming from RAPID API hub and it needs your personal key. I am not using .env files due to its simplicity of the project.
